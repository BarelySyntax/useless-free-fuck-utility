# The Useless Fuck Utility

I made the useless fuck utility, in my free time. It's really useless and worthless, i prefer placing it in `/bin/` for systemwide effects or simply `~/.local/bin/` so that it can easily be accessed.

# USAGE
Open the terminal and type in (assuming it is in `/bin/` or `~/.local/bin/`):

`fuck NAME #Name anything really!`

Example output:

`Alice was piped into until buffer overflow`

`Table got pointer dereferenced unsafely`

# Useless Information
I will also provide a x86_64 pre-compiled version for Linux only, if you are on other operating systems. You unfortunately need to compile it from source.
